The Classic Monopoly Chance and Community Chest cards have had lots of tweaks over the years.

Before 2008, there were different versions of the Chance and Community Chest cards in the US, the UK, and other countries.

In 2008, they were standardized across the world, but there are still some small differences (like ‘Advance to Boardwalk’ versus ‘Advance to Mayfair’).

In October 2021, the Monopoly Community Chest cards got a HUGE shakeup, as for the first time in the history of Monopoly, the whole deck has been re-written!
