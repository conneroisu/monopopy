# ðŸ¤– Monopoly MCP Server - AI Agent Usage Guide

This document explains how AI agents (LLMs) can connect to and play the Monopoly game using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Starting the MCP Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the MCP server
uv run monopoly-mcp
```

The server will start and listen for MCP client connections.

### Connecting AI Agents

AI agents can connect to the server using any MCP-compatible client. The server exposes the following tools:

## ðŸŽ® AI Agent Gameplay Strategy

### Basic Gameplay Loop

1. **Join/Create Game**: Use `create_game` to start a new game
2. **Check Turn**: Use `get_game_state` to see if it's your turn
3. **Play Turn**: Use `play_turn` with action "roll" to roll dice and move
4. **Handle Landing**: Based on where you land:
   - **Property**: Use `buy_property` or `decline_property`
   - **Special spaces**: Handle automatically (taxes, cards, etc.)
5. **Repeat**: Continue until game ends

### Example AI Turn Sequence

```python
# 1. Check if it's my turn
state = mcp_client.call_tool("get_game_state", {"game_id": "game_1"})
if state["current_player"] != "MyAI":
    return  # Not my turn

# 2. Play turn (roll dice)
turn_result = mcp_client.call_tool("play_turn", {
    "game_id": "game_1",
    "player_name": "MyAI",
    "action": "roll"
})

# 3. Handle property purchase decision
if "landed_on" in turn_result:
    # Simple strategy: buy if affordable and good value
    state = mcp_client.call_tool("get_game_state", {"game_id": "game_1"})
    my_money = next(p["money"] for p in state["players"] if p["name"] == "MyAI")
    
    if my_money > 300:  # Keep some cash buffer
        mcp_client.call_tool("buy_property", {
            "game_id": "game_1",
            "player_name": "MyAI",
            "property_name": turn_result["landed_on"]
        })
    else:
        mcp_client.call_tool("decline_property", {
            "game_id": "game_1",
            "player_name": "MyAI"
        })
```

## ðŸ§  Advanced AI Strategies

### Property Investment Strategy
- **Early Game**: Focus on completing color groups (monopolies)
- **Mid Game**: Build houses/hotels on monopolies
- **Late Game**: Manage cash flow and debt

### Risk Management
- Keep cash reserves for rent payments
- Monitor opponent property ownership
- Calculate expected returns on property investments

### Competitive Analysis
- Track opponent wealth and property portfolios
- Identify blocking opportunities
- Time trades strategically

## ðŸ”§ Integration Examples

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monopoly": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "monopoly-mcp"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/monopopy"
    }
  }
}
```

### Python Client Example

```python
from fastmcp.client import FastMCPClient

async def play_monopoly():
    client = FastMCPClient()
    
    # Create game
    result = await client.call_tool("create_game", {
        "player_names": ["AI_1", "AI_2"]
    })
    game_id = result["game_id"]
    
    # Game loop
    while True:
        state = await client.call_tool("get_game_state", {"game_id": game_id})
        
        if state["game_over"]:
            print(f"Game over! Winner: {state['winner']}")
            break
            
        current_player = state["current_player"]
        
        # Play turn for current player
        turn_result = await client.call_tool("play_turn", {
            "game_id": game_id,
            "player_name": current_player,
            "action": "roll"
        })
        
        print(f"{current_player} rolled {turn_result['dice']}")
        
        # Handle property purchases with simple AI logic
        if "landed_on" in turn_result:
            # Buy if we have enough money
            player_data = next(p for p in state["players"] if p["name"] == current_player)
            if player_data["money"] > 500:
                await client.call_tool("buy_property", {
                    "game_id": game_id,
                    "player_name": current_player,
                    "property_name": turn_result["landed_on"]
                })
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Your AI Agent

Use the provided test script to verify your MCP integration:

```bash
uv run python test_mcp_server.py
```

This will verify that:
- The MCP server starts correctly
- All tools are properly registered
- Basic game functionality works
- Game state is properly managed

## ðŸ“Š Game Rules Summary

For AI agents to play effectively, they should understand:

- **Objective**: Be the last player with money (eliminate opponents through bankruptcy)
- **Turn Flow**: Roll dice â†’ Move â†’ Handle space â†’ End turn
- **Property System**: Buy properties â†’ Build monopolies â†’ Collect rent
- **Cash Management**: Balance property investment with cash reserves
- **Special Spaces**: Handle Chance/Community Chest cards, taxes, jail

## ðŸš€ Getting Started Checklist

- [ ] Install dependencies: `uv sync`
- [ ] Test MCP server: `uv run python test_mcp_server.py`
- [ ] Start MCP server: `uv run monopoly-mcp`
- [ ] Connect your AI client to the server
- [ ] Create a game with `create_game`
- [ ] Implement basic turn-taking logic
- [ ] Add property purchase decision-making
- [ ] Test with multiple AI agents

The Monopoly MCP server provides a complete, production-ready interface for AI agents to play the classic board game. Have fun building intelligent agents that can master the art of property trading and wealth management!
